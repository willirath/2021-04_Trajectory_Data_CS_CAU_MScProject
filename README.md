## Mode of interaction

- Work in a Github repository. Create a new one or fork this one.

- Use the Github project board for all project management (milestones, deadlines, etc.) [Docs are here.](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards)

## Data

Rath, Willi, Schmidt, Christina, & RÃ¼hs, Siren. (2021). Mediterranean Sea Trajectory Data Examples (Version v2020.03.31.1) [Data set]. Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4650317

## Mission

Pick one of the following topics:

- _**Visualize:**_ Build an app for interactive visualization of the data.
- _**Optimize:**_ Structure the data for the fastest possible lookup based on region and trajectories. (May also be part of one of the other topics.)
- -**Analyze:**_ Use machine learning to identify and quantify emerging pathways.
